    Print a message to the terminal one character at a time, with a delay of
    0.05 seconds between each character. The function wraps long lines to fit
    the terminal width, and clears the screen before printing. If the user
    presses a key during the printing, the function stops and waits for the user
    to press another key.

    Parameters   : message (str): The message to be printed.
